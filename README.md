## Introduction and Aims ##

Language Families
Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.

Java can help us build a model to track inherited traits across families. In this case, we’ll focus on something that often varies between language families: word order — where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order. But in Japanese, you would use subject-object-verb order.

Your Language Inheritance package has three Java files:

1. Language.java: for the Language parent class, which serves as the template for all languages.
2. Mayan.java: for Mayan, a child class of Language modeled after the Mayan language family.
3. SinoTibetan.java: for SinoTibetan, a child class of Language modeled after the Sino-Tibetan language family.

Build out a Java package with these classes to model real-world language families.
